            <p>
                Technology in general has always fascinated me. I can always be found brainstorming new ideas, reading
                up on
                the
                latest tech news or devising solutions to solve common problems. After building my first website around
                the
                age
                of 8 using nothing but Notepad, I found everything about programming interesting. The fact that it is
                ever
                changing made it even more fun to pursue. My ultimate goal is to become a truly bespoke Full Stack
                Developer,
                someone who can jump into any project head-on without being hindered by a lack of general knowledge,
                absence
                of
                experience with different programming languages, or an inability to understand what a client wants, even
                when
                they may not have a clear idea themselves.

                            This industry can be frustrating and difficult at times, but out of all the jobs I
                            have ever had, I have experienced no greater satisfaction than when I am presented with a
                            challenging task, working through the problem and ultimately finding a solution that meets
                            the
                            clients needs and and brings them happiness-es pecially when it would be easier to find
                            shortcuts.
