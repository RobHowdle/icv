            <p>When I’m not at work, I enjoy keeping busy. I have a strong passion for learning new things, which drives
                me
                to make the most of my time. I actively engage in various communities, both online and offline, and
                embrace
                spontaneity. Through these activities and communities, I have accomplished several achievements that I
                take
                great pride in.

                    <p>In 2011, I stumbled upon the Droid Building Community, a global gathering of Star Wars fans who
                        collaborate to construct replica droids from the Star Wars Universe. Given my preexisting
                        fascination
                        electronics, building and a deep love for Star Wars, I embarked on my journey within this
                        community.
                        Over time, I have contributed to its growth by developing online tools like a Parts Checklist
                        and
                        Instruction Guides aiding new builders in finding their footing within the vast community.
                        Additionally,
                        I established a dedicated Discord Server and organised round-the-clock Zoom calls during the
                        pandemic.

                    <p>
                        I have been involved in music since a very young age, playing a variety of instruments including
                        guitar,
                        drums and bass. Over the years, I have been part of several bands. primarily focusing on the
                        Rock/
                        Metal
                        genres, however I draw inspiration from a diverse range of musical styles when creating my own
                        compositions.My musical journey has taken me to various recording studios, where I have had the
                        opportunity to record. Additionally, I have performed at notable venues like The Forum Music
                        Center
                        in
                        Darlington and the O2 Academy in Birmingham which were unforgettable experiences. My bands have
                        also
                        garnered radio airplay, achieved finalist places within local talent shows and produced music
                        videos. I
                        am in the process of recording my first solo album, which comprises entirely of original songs.

                    <p>
                        I have a passion for expanding my knowledge both within and outside of work. I enjoy engaging in
                        diverse creative projects, ranging from craft endeavours to coding ventures. For instance, I
                        have
                        turned a 3D printed model of a prop from the TV show ‘Supernatural’ and creating a custom case
                        comprising of a hand carved base covered in velvet as well as stained wood and hand burnt
                        symbols
                        unique to the show. In terms of coding projects, I encountered challenges in the past when
                        searching
                        for suitable band members. While numerous musician finder websites exist, I took it upon myself
                        to
                        create my own solution. I am developing a forum-style application that allows individuals or
                        bands
                        to advertise their musical needs or offerings, incorporating paid subscription tiers for
                        enhanced
                        functionality and features.

                    <p>
                        I derive great satisfaction from helping those less fortunate than myself. Over the years, I
                        have
                        organised numerous charity events with the help of various communities I belong to, as well as
                        through my music. All the money raised during these goes went directly to the intended causes.
                        One notable instance occurred in December 2018 when a family close to my childhood
                        neighbourhood experienced a devastating house fire. Tragically, one of their young children lost
                        their life, and the family lost not only the child but all of their possessions. Wanting to lend
                        a
                        hand, I hastily organise a benefit concert, reaching out to as many bands as possible. The
                        atmosphere on the night was indescribable as musicians from diverse backgrounds came together
                        with a
                        single goal: to raise as much money as possible to help this family. Despite the event taking
                        place
                        days before Christmas, we managed to collect over £400, which was remarkable. Alongside Father
                        Christmas and his elves, I personally visited the family to deliver the funds, accompanied by a
                        collection of gifts generously donated by the community. Whilst I know that nothing can fully
                        heal
                        the wounds caused by these tragic events, the knowledge that I played a part in bringing some
                        relief
                        and happiness to these individuals, even if only momentarily, makes it all worthwhile.

                        The COVID-19 pandemic sparked a newfound appreciate for the outdoors within me. Whenever the
                        opportunity arises, I cherish the chance to venture outside and immerse myself in nature. The
                        solace
                        I find amidst the trees, hill, historical sites and the wonders of the natural world provide
                        respite
                        from a life intertwined with technology. Whether embarking on late-night drives, day trips or
                        embarking on spontaneous journeys to uncharted destinations on the map, I am captivated by the
                        allure of the great outdoors.The act of venturing out and exploring the world holds immense
                        therapeutic value for me. It allows me to unwind, clear my mind, connect with nature and
                        discover
                        the boundless wonders that our planet has to offer which are often overlooked by so many.
