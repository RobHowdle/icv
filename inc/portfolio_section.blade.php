        <p>
            I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to collaborate with wonderful clients
            throughout my career. Over the years, I have engaged in diverse projects, encompassing the
            development of Content Management Systems for businesses and gymnastics clubs, the create of
            brochure websites for both new and established businesses, and the creation of e-commerce websites.
            In addition to client projects, I enjoy dedicating my personal time to working on endeavours for
            various communities I am part of, as well as pursuing random project ideas that spark my interest. I
            also enjoy actively participating in Developer Discord Servers, where I provide assistance to fellow
            developers, offering valuable suggestions and provide reviews on people’s projects.

                    <p>At Discovery Design, I created a website for a recruitment company using Wordpress CMS, Custom

                        implemented the desired functionality. The use of flexible content empowered clients to
                        customise their site across multiple pages, surpassing initial design limitations</p>

                    <p>I developed a personal Laravel project that enables users from my Droid Building Community to
                        create customised checklists for tracking their progress in building a robot. With numerous
                        parts involved in constructing a droid, this web application allows users to create accounts,
                        select the specific droid they are building, and even customise it with different versions to
                        cater to their individual requirements. The application scans the file structure create by the
                        droid creators and automatically generates a checklist divided into sections that mirror the
                        structure. This feature enables users to effortlessly locate the necessary parts they need.</p>

                    <p>I contributed to the development of a custom Discord Server Bot called Art. Built using
                        JavaScript, this bot offers a range of features that are both useful to users and provide some
                        entertaining games to play. Artoo can assign roles to users, respond to user input based on its
                        pre-set mood, tell jokes, play games, and even search a wiki for user-specified content.
